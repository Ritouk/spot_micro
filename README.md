## Objectives

- **Robot Mobility**: The robot should be able to move within its environment.
- **Self-Correction**: Utilize an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to correct its orientation and posture.
- **Depth Sensing**: Implement depth sensing using sonar and camera for obstacle detection and navigation.
- **Follow Me Mode**: Enable the robot to follow a user autonomously.
- **Emotes**: Allow the robot to express basic emotions to enhance interaction.

## Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: The robot can autonomously navigate its surroundings, avoiding obstacles.
- **IMU-Based Self-Correction**: Real-time orientation correction using IMU data.
- **Depth Sensing**: Uses sonar and camera to measure distance to objects and navigate safely.
- **Follow Me Mode**: The robot can follow a person using visual and distance tracking.
- **Emotes**: The robot can display basic emotions such as happiness, sadness, and surprise.
